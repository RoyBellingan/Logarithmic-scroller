An overcomplex solution for a problem no one realized to have

In short is a faster pagination, in where the page sequence will be 

(assuming 1000 pages)

1 2 4 8 15 40 80 230 540 750

you click 80 ?

3 34 74 79 80 81 88 130 260 450

The idea is to SHOW a small number of option (and thus save spaces) 10 option.
I can not proove but this, but 98% of the time with a max of 5 click you reach any page (in this set ot 1000)!

Is a logaritmic scroller, instead of a linear one
